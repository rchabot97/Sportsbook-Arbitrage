# Sportsbook-Arbitrage

Simple widget that allows users to input American betting odds for two opposing players or teams in a sporting event, and computes appropriate bet sizing for arbitrage opportunities. Payouts are as even as possible across outcomes while rounded figures are returned to prevent suspicious amounts from being wagered, and bet sizes can be calibrated according to the user's bankroll or desired wager amount.
